A julia package for Whittle and debiased Whittle likelihood inference. Provides the following functionality:

- Simulating Gaussian processes with a given autocovariance.
- Computation of the Whittle likelihood, its gradient and its Hessian (including with an arbitrary taper). 
- Computation of the Debiased Whittle likelihood, its gradient and its Hessian (including with an arbitrary taper).
- Plotting recipes for second-order properties of interest, including the spectral density function and autocovariance.
- Approximation of the autocovariance from the spectral density function (and for gradients and Hessians).
- Example models including 1D OU and 1D Matern, 2D correlated OU process and arbitrary dimentional Matern.
- Basic non-parametric estimators including the Periodogram and Bartlett's method with plotting recipes.
